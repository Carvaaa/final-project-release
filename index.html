        <li>There will be also many beautiful churches as Portugal has always been very catholic.</li>
        <li>Portugal has a great relationship with the sea. It's what allowed us to discover so many countries and
          become great, when visiting monuments, it will most likely be connected with the sea and how the Portuguese
          navigated through the strong waves and winds. Definitely worth getting to know the history behind Portugal and
          the sea.</li>
        <li>Portugal doesn't just have sea discoveries though, there's many fearsome battles, conquering and exploring
          throughout many countries.</li>

      <ul dir="rtl" id="foodls">
        <li>It is without a doubt that Portugal has one of the best cuisines in the world.</li>
        <li>Wether it be Seafood, pastry, sandwiches, soups or meat dishes, the Portuguese culinaire culture always has
          amazing food to offer, and also cheap at that.</li>
        <li>But it's not just about the food, Portugal is also famous for it's great wine and the amount of wine that
          Portuguese people consume. It's a very high number, and for a good reason. Portuguese wine is flavorful and
          delicate, a real joy to accompany the tasty meals we offer.</li>
        <li>Although wine is very famous in Portugal, it is very recommended to try beer as well, some people don't know
          but Portugal has decent beer, and it helps to freshen up when it's a hot day outside.</li>
        <li>Portugal has so many other drinks, like sodas, excelent expressos, the famous "Ginginha", a liquor in a
          chocolate cup and a delightful natural sparkling water, and it's very rare to have naturally carbonated water.
        </li>
        <li>So for food Portugal will not dissapoint.</li>
